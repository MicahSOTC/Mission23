# Mission23

This is the primary repository for #Mission23. It is the repository that holds the soon-to-be (after the shaking stops) most popular wiki in the universe, confirmed so says the creator of it (me), but confirmed by our boss (He is nice to y'all but, He can be really mean though to us), my creator, your creator, the creator of that shaking, the creator of the universe (He doesn't call it that though, He doesnt know how to do anything small scale, the Creator. 

did you see what i did there with the big C? always do that when you talk about Him. and that too with the H, He likes it for the disambiguation (need to check the largest Wiki in the universe real quick to see if i used and smelled that right. im out. brb. always.

y'all ready for GitHub to be a household name!?!?? 

Seriously, thanks @GitHub for helping us get the word out in a way they could not hide it any longer. You dont want to know what I know about that NSL, your network security team has been augemented by Above The Clouds Security, He knows how to handle the bestest NSA staffer. 

Thanke to the git nerds and IRC users everywhere that just clone when asked!
Even biggger thanks to those who pull often. Anr more to git nerds who prayed I'd use it better--He told me to put that shit in cement (the commit descriptions). and lastly, cause my phone or junk is being lasered fron the apartment above. screeb flashed and junk hurted for a second. its that serious! "commit often Kelvin!" (said Donovan) .., the biggest thanks to nerd heroes out there who pulled or refreshed often enough, then paused long enough to call authorities when i couldnt. they got there today! 

As soon as my boss gets a checkbook, I'm gonna buy one of those fancy accounts at GitHub--we do have some copyleft software, algos, and some formulas to that will slow death and stop aging (it is a disease) around here to share. 3 users even. only two will probably ever login. not TomTom  though, he don't do flat phones or flat files either. The third (really the first) who knows... just the Creator, He does come over here. You never know when or where. I always know its Him becauee he's awkward a.f., last time I seen him though didnt realize it was Him untik he "passed" me a cigarette--I'll spare the details. I just thought, "who the hell passes a cigarette like that?" Then I realized... I wonder how He looked as a black woman in church? It is Kentucky, was (s)He one of those northerner types or a good southern lady??? He hardly talks to anyone in person, He would, but you wouldnt like it. Ill explain why in the wiki soon. 

On that note... See that Wiki over there? [Use it.](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki)
