Yesterday I had a hookup. So convenient. No long convos, negotiations, and right next door to where I was in midtown.

I had no problems rising to the occassion (apparrently having beg my subconscious to do its job and oftennhaving to call the Creator to actually help me is a billion in aid--see pic) or getting attacked. 

across the hall I noticed a ghost hanging on the door. I thought it was Halloween until I noticed the apartment number 4223.

In typical fashion they tried to kill me, then sent out their legion of trolls and cloaked commanders to shut down the fun I was having.

I cannot get in touch with Will now, we did have fun, but hes made "the switch" people often do thaf weirdness after interactions with me that are positive. Hopefully he just broke his phone or something... The CIA doesnt spend money on Apple products and texts are now not iMessage (see pic).

Most importantly, That’s not TomTom in Musk’s tweet. I do worry about the guy pictured, they’ve killed practically every lookalike they ever hired.
