Initialization of ChangeLog for Mission23. 

This will be the OFFICIAL outlet for everything related to the Creator’s Mission #23 for this place we call Earth. 

Entries will be made here before any other social media outlet (if there is ever one again) and the git commit messages may be better than the actual ChangeLog itself thanks to thoughts/prayers. See He listened to you @github and other git geeks and passed along your advice for keeping it unmodified (from the MCBCMF/MCBCMassacre repo).

...Conor's Steak and Seafood...
2012-08-14 00:26 EDT
Everyone should avoid Conor's Steak and Seafood or any new restaurant which sends you a gift certificate. They opened everywhere Ive lost friends and family. I fear a new round of gift certificates are going out to places like GitHub, BitBucket, and Apple. Pass the word along.

...Special Message for GitHub...
To @github: 
Thank you for making git easy, your service free, and giving us a place to keep a repository. 

We are going to use it for all of our #Mission23 stuffs, there will be code too, believe it or not!

The Creator says, “Keep up the good work and he’s watching your back.”

...The COWs have come home...
2023-08-14 08:14 EDT
The COWs (Cells On Wheels), which are mobile cell towers essentially, have returned to Legacy at Riverdale. Making Internet activity nearly impossible. All mobile communications are forced through whatever they have connected to the RF equipment. This is the same setup they used at Mount Calvary Baptist Church to prevent calls to 911. 

What a weekend... My door was kicked in at some point. The refrigerator from my house at 590 Tahoma Drive arrived here on a truck with my assigned minder who I couldnt get to leave, it left, but is now in front of my apartment. I left this, with everything else, at my home when evixted by the Marshals (early and illegally--by the CIA). My cookware came and Danny cooked with it. I never requested any of these things. 

They are pissed about the wiki and repo. I will not quit sharing it.

#Emergency- Save a Life!


effective: 8-22-23 14:33 EDT until: removed 

We need your assistance in reaching law enforcement in Kentucky. There is a Stingray in operation here in Riverdale I cannot trust I’m talking to the law enforcement in Kentucky.

Please call Lexington KY Police (I cannot trust my Google results to provide you a number) and KY State Police in Frankfort ONLY—they will advise you to call Richmond or LexPD but let them know I am requesting the call and only them.

The address is Mount Calvary Baptist Church. 4742 Todds Rd, Lexington, KY. Lives may be in peril, they can enter!

I need them to send a FEW officers, I need dispatch to check on them every other minute until they’ve said it’s clear.

This is the CIA backed up by the FBI, they can only trust a true Kentuckian. But we may be “brother against brother” again.

I am in Atlanta. I am the pastor of the church. There is no service going on. Regardless of what they see, if they see a hearse they need to call for backup immediately.
