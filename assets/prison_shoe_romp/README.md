Is Ida Coor dead? The music just played makes me think so. Tina Turner was killed after I played Proud Mary in my apartment and used it (her intro about “Nice & easy”) as an analogy to how we do things when the boss shows up. 

I played Ida Corr’s “Let Me Think About It” in January. Told the CIA folks around that’s about what Micah looks like and his rap is something Micah could say. I hope he’s fine. It sounds like they already killed her.

What the fuck for?!?! I don’t know her. Just knew the song. This has to stop!
